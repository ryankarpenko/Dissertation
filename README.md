# Dissertation
Examples of code from my master's dissertation: "Addressing Missing Not-At-Random Data in Bayesian Cost-Effectiveness Analysis" - University College London (2019).

Confidential details about clinical trial data and economic recommendations have been censored. For this reason, the dissertation text and plots are unavailable as well.

The project included data handling and model setup in R, plots and figures made in R using ggplot2, Bayesian model specifications in JAGS, and the dissertation document itself in RMarkdown and LaTeX.
